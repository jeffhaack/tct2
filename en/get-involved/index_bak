                        <p>Summer 2017 is approaching quickly, and we will be seeking international volunteers to help with the tough work of building the Transcaucasian Trail in Georgia (Svaneti), and Armenia (Dilijan-Ijevan area). The work will involve blazing trails, building tread way, putting up signs, building bridges, and other manual labour. So if you want to work hard, have fun, and contribute to a worthwhile cause, we want you! We will provide an educational, fun, no-frills experience for those interested in taking on the challenging and rewarding work that will support the creation of the trail. Get ready to make new friends, enjoy the beautiful mountain scenery, and learn about the Caucasus, trail building, and conservation.</p>
                        <p>We will be posting more details and the 2017 application form soon – stay tuned. Make sure you don't miss it by <a href="/en#newsletter">signing up for our newsletter.</a></p>

                        <p>During July and August the team will build a trail connecting Svaneti and Racha. Some sections of the trail still exist from old times, but are wildly overgrown. Currently the way is passable by the very experienced and adventurous, but our work this summer will open the trail to anyone and everyone who wishes to make this spectacular trek. With this key route opened, hikers will be able to walk the TCT uninterrupted for well over 100 kilometers. </p>

                    <p>A good map is so important when heading into the mountains. While it can be fun to get lost, it's important to know your way back to civilization. Nobody wants to end up disoriented and in a dangerous situation.</p>

                    <p>To this end, one of our programs is to help improve the maps and map data in the areas of the Caucasus around the TCT. We are utilizing the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform, which is an open source map of the world, developed by a large, worldwide volunteer community. We have chosen this platform because:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>of its robust, developed infrastructure.</li>
                            <li>the data feeds directly into countless existing services, apps, and websites.</li>
                            <li>it is open, meaning all of the data in the OSM database may be used for any purpose, with minimal licensing restrictions. In other words, everyone has access to the raw geographic data to make maps with as they please.</li>
                            <li>there is a strong volunteer community already using OSM and familiar with it.</li>
                            <li>we believe in data sharing, community sourced information, and open source as core principles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    </br>
                    <center><h4>How can you help?</h4></center>

                    <p>There are two ways to help us make better maps: remote mapping and field mapping. Remote mapping involves helping us out from home, while field mapping means exploring new routes or collecting more data on old routes, using GPS, pen and paper.</p>

                    <center><h3>Remote Mapping</h3></center>

                    <p>Help us from home by donating an hour or more of your time to help us make maps! This typically involves tracing satellite images with your mouse - drawing forests, rivers and more that will feed into our maps.</p>

                    <center><img width="550px" src="/assets/vid/osm-edit.gif"></center>

                    <p>If you can help us by mapping remotely, great! If you've never contributed to <a href="http://openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> before, it may take a short time to get started, but once you grasp the basics, it's very easy. To learn the basics, we recommend <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/welcome" target="_blank">starting with this guide</a>. Once you have an idea how it works, and you have signed up for an account on OpenStreetMap, then read through our short guide to learn how you can contribute mapping for the TCT!

                    <p>If you are planning to (or would like to) hike some trails in the Caucasus, we want your help! Specifically, we want your GPS data, route notes, and photos, so that we can continue to improve our database of trail information.</p>

                    <p>Are you planning to hike in the Caucasus? Do you like exploring new, unexplored trails? If so, we could use your help.</p>

                    <p>Part of designing the best Transcaucasian Trail possible is exploring and mapping the thousands of routes that may or may not exist - such as those that are unmapped or may have existed in the past but are now grown over. We need (and fellow hikers also need) information about these trails. When do we turn right instead of left? Where can we get water? Where are the good camping spots? By documenting new routes, you can help us plan the TCT while also providing valuable information to the growing body of hikers in the region.</p>

                    <p>If you are planning to hike in the Caucasus, we want your knowledge! Visit the link below to learn more about mapping your hikes, collecting helpful information, and writing trail descriptions for others to follow.</p>

We can provide you with information about various regions, areas where we need exploration, or even specific trails which need to be mapped.</p>
